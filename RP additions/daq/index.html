<h1>Data acquisition</h1>
<p>The DAQ application is ready.</p>
<p>Now you can run the control program.</p>
<p>More details about this application can be found at <a href="https://pavel-demin.github.io/red-pitaya-notes/mcpha/" target="_blank">not yet available link</a>.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<ul>
<li>Connect a signal source or the OUT1 to the IN1 connector on the Red Pitaya board. </li>
<li>Additionally you can connect another signal to the IN2 connector.</li>
<li>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/releases/download/20240204/red-pitaya-notes-20240204.zip">not yet available git repo</a>.</li>
<li>Edit the config to your needs (ip is required). To play around with the values, the <a href="../mcpha">mcpha application</a> might proove useful.</li>
<li>Run the <code>rpDAQ.py</code> program.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional Information for developers</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is based upon the 20240204 release</li>
<li>The FPGA Image is the same as the one of the mcpha except the FIR Filter was removed.</li>
<li>The Server Application is the same as the one of the mcpha except an additional command (31, 0, n) was added which starts the daq thread.</li>
<li>The DAQ thread waits for the triggerflag and then sends the data, resets and starts the osci n times.</li>
<li>As the DAQ thread first waits for the triggerflag you need to reset and start the oscilloscope before running the DAQ for the first time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>MimoCoRB</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Client also offers an interface to <a href="https://github.com/GuenterQuast/mimoCoRB">MimoCoRB</a> which offers a framework for further live analysis.</li>
